# Face Recognizer Using OpenCV

This repository contains a face recognition system built with OpenCV. The project allows for the identification and verification of faces in images or video streams.

## Features

Detects and recognizes faces in real-time.
Uses OpenCV for image processing and face recognition.

## Data

Face recognition requires a dataset of images with known faces. Ensure you have a dataset organized in the appropriate format for training and testing.

## Model

The project uses OpenCV's pre-trained face detection and recognition models. Detailed implementation is provided in the `face_recognition.py` script.

## Results

Real-time face recognition results are displayed in a window. Additional metrics and performance details can be found in the code comments.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Open issues or submit pull requests to enhance the project.
